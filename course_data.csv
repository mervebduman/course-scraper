"Prescription Drug Regulation, Cost, and Access: Current Controversies in Context",Duration not found,2 - 5 hours per week,Health & Medicine,Prescription drugs are among the most common health care interventions and have turned many once-fatal diseases into manageable conditions — but they have also been a growing source of controversy. Patients and physicians in the US struggle with increasing costs and express concerns about why certain conditions like Alzheimer’s disease remain without therapeutic options.,https://pll.harvard.edu/course/prescription-drug-regulation-cost-and-access-current-controversies-context
Data Science: Inference and Modeling,Duration not found,1 - 2 hours per week,Data Science,"Statistical inference and modeling are indispensable for analyzing data affected by chance, and thus essential for data scientists. In this course, you will learn these key concepts through a motivating case study on election forecasting.",https://pll.harvard.edu/course/data-science-inference-and-modeling
Case Studies in Functional Genomics,5 weeks long,2 - 4 hours per week,Data Science,"We will explain how to perform the standard processing and normalization steps, starting with raw data, to get to the point where one can investigate relevant biological questions. Throughout the case studies, we will make use of exploratory plots to get a general overview of the shape of the data and the result of the experiment. We start with RNA-seq data analysis covering basic concepts and a first look at FASTQ files. We will also go over quality control of FASTQ files; aligning RNA-seq reads; visualizing alignments and move on to analyzing RNA-seq at the gene-level : counting reads in genes; Exploratory Data Analysis and variance stabilization for counts; count-based differential expression; normalization and batch effects. Finally, we cover RNA-seq at the transcript-level : inferring expression of transcripts (i.e. alternative isoforms); differential exon usage. We will learn the basic steps in analyzing DNA methylation data, including reading the raw data, normalization, and finding regions of differential methylation across multiple samples. The course will end with a brief description of the basic steps for analyzing ChIP-seq datasets, from read alignment, to peak calling, and assessing differential binding patterns across multiple samples.",https://pll.harvard.edu/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-7-case-studies-functional-genomics
Introduction to Bioconductor,4 weeks long,2 - 4 hours per week,Data Science,"We begin with an introduction to the relevant biology, explaining what we measure and why. Then we focus on the two main measurement technologies: next generation sequencing and microarrays. We then move on to describing how raw data and experimental information are imported into R and how we use Bioconductor classes to organize these data, whether generated locally, or harvested from public repositories or institutional archives. Genomic features are generally identified using intervals in genomic coordinates, and highly efficient algorithms for computing with genomic intervals will be examined in detail. Statistical methods for testing gene-centric or pathway-centric hypotheses with genome-scale data are found in packages such as limma, some of these techniques will be illustrated in lectures and labs.",https://pll.harvard.edu/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-5-introduction-bioconductor-annotation-and-analysis-genomes-and
Advanced Bioconductor,5 weeks long,2 - 4 hours per week,Data Science,"In this course, we begin with approaches to visualization of genome-scale data, and provide tools to build interactive graphical interfaces to speed discovery and interpretation. Using knitr and rmarkdown as basic authoring tools, the concept of reproducible research is developed, and the concept of an executable document is presented. In this framework reports are linked tightly to the underlying data and code, enhancing reproducibility and extensibility of completed analyses. We study out-of-memory approaches to the analysis of very large data resources, using relational databases or HDF5 as ""back ends"" with familiar R interfaces. Multiomic data integration is illustrated using a curated version of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Finally, we explore cloud-resident resources developed for the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (the ENCODE project). These address transcription factor binding, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq with CRISPR interference.",https://pll.harvard.edu/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-6-high-performance-computing-reproducible-genomics
Statistics and R,4 weeks long,2 - 4 hours per week,Data Science,"We will learn the basics of statistical inference in order to understand and compute p-values and confidence intervals, all while analyzing data with R. We provide R programming examples in a way that will help make the connection between concepts and implementation. Problem sets requiring R programming will be used to test understanding and ability to implement basic data analyses. We will use visualization techniques to explore new data sets and determine the most appropriate approach. We will describe robust statistical techniques as alternatives when data do not fit assumptions required by the standard approaches. By using R scripts to analyze data, you will learn the basics of conducting reproducible research.",https://pll.harvard.edu/course/statistics-and-r
High-Dimensional Data Analysis,4 weeks long,2 - 4 hours per week,Data Science,"If you’re interested in data analysis and interpretation, then this is the data science course for you. We start by learning the mathematical definition of distance and use this to motivate the use of the singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimension reduction and multi-dimensional scaling and its connection to principal component analysis. We will learn about the batch effect: the most challenging data analytical problem in genomics today and describe how the techniques can be used to detect and adjust for batch effects. Specifically, we will describe the principal component analysis and factor analysis and demonstrate how these concepts are applied to data visualization and data analysis of high-throughput experimental data.",https://pll.harvard.edu/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-4-high-dimensional-data-analysis
Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments,4 weeks long,2 - 4 hours per week,Data Science,"In this course, you’ll learn various statistics topics including multiple testing problems, error rates, error rate controlling procedures, false discovery rates, q-values, and exploratory data analysis. We then introduce statistical modeling and how it is applied to high-throughput data. In particular, we will discuss parametric distributions, including binomial, exponential, and gamma, and describe maximum likelihood estimation. We provide several examples of how these concepts are applied in next-generation sequencing and microarray data. Finally, we will discuss hierarchical models and empirical Bayes along with some examples of how these are used in practice. We provide R programming examples in a way that will help make the connection between concepts and implementation.",https://pll.harvard.edu/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-3-statistical-inference-and-modeling-high-throughput-experiments
"Principles, Statistical and Computational Tools for Reproducible Data Science",8 weeks long,3 - 8 hours per week,Data Science,"Today the principles and techniques of reproducible research are more important than ever, across diverse disciplines from astrophysics to political science. No one wants to do research that can’t be reproduced. Thus, this course is really for anyone who is doing any intensive data research. While many of us come from a biomedical background, this course is for a broad audience of data scientists.",https://pll.harvard.edu/course/principles-statistical-and-computational-tools-reproducible-data-science
